Installation
============

Requirements
------------

 * Python 3 (3.7+) or pypy3
 * Exempi 2.2.0+
 * Linux or OS X (see notes below for Windows)


Python XMP Toolkit
----------------------
The short version of installation is::

  python setup.py install

or if you use pip::

  pip install python-xmp-toolkit

Exempi
------
Python XMP Toolkit requires Exempi 2.2.0 or higher which can be downloaded from
http://libopenraw.freedesktop.org/wiki/Exempi.  It is probably already
installed if you are working on linux.

To install Exempi, unpack the distribution and run::

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

Versions below 2.2.0 will not work. Note, Exempi may also be available in your
systems package manager, e.g.::

    sudo apt-get install libexempi3  # (Ubuntu/Debian)
    brew install exempi  # (Homebrew on OS X)

Mac OS X
--------
Note Exempi requires boost (http://www.boost.org/) to compile, so on OS
X you probably need to run configure with one of the following options::

  ./configure --with-boost=/usr/local # (for Homebrew)
  ./configure --with-darwinports
  ./configure --with-fink

Windows
-------
The library has not been tested on Windows, and nor has any serious effort
been made to test it. Hence, developers wanting to use the library on Windows
are encouraged to try it out and let us know if it works.

The library ought to work on Windows, if Exempi can be compiled as a DLL using
e.g. Cygwin.
